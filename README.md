# Wes Bos - ES6 For Everyone
Javascript development still at it way to growing even more. ES6 comes out and now it's already at ES8. So i took a step to learn of whats new and whats usefull of Javascript update. [Wes Bos - ES6 For Everyone](https://es6.io) is a good tutorial for learning and understanding ES6 or even ES8!

## Some Changes
Some module that used in the video has been updated to major version. Some properties does not relevant if you want to use the most updated version. I made some change my self so i can work with that update. ( There will be no problem if you stick around with the same version that used in the video. Search at how to install specific version of that module. )

### Webpack 4 and babel-preset-env
Since Webpack has been updated to version 4 and `babel-preset-es2015-native-modules` does not relevant anymore. @wesbos current properties for Webpack 2 can't be use for Webpack 4. Use my properties instead by using Webpack 4 and `babel-preset-env`, or stay still with Webpack 2 by using :
```
npm i webpack@2.7.0
```
and use properties on Wes Bos video.

### SystemJS
i can't see at how to make SystemJS work properly. so i skipped it. use Webpack instead.
