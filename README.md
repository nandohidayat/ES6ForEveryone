# ES6 For Everyone

### Some Changes

#### Webpack 4 and babel-preset-env
Since Webpack has been updated to version 4 and `babel-preset-es2015-native-modules` does not relevant anymore. @wesbos current properties for Webpack 2 can't be use for Webpack 4. Use my properties instead by using Webpack 4 and `babel-preset-env`, or stay still with Webpack 2 by using :
```
npm i webpack@2.7.0
```
and use properties on Wes Bos video.
